# Xexeu's todo

https://jhonnymichel.github.io/react-todo/
This is my first application built with React for learning purposes.

## Featuring
1. Nice animations done by scratch so I could learn stuff
2. The possibility to create, edit and delete todos.
3. The possibility to order todos by date, done and undone.

## how to play with it
1. clone the repository
2. cd to the cloned directory in your computer
3. install dependencies (you will need nodejs installed in your computer before)
  ``` npm install ```
4. run the dev server
  ```npm run dev```
5. access the served content at localhost:8080
